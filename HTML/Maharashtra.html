        Maharashtra (/məhɑːˈrɑːʃtrə/; Marathi: [məharaːʂʈɾə] (audio speaker iconlisten),
         abbr. MH or Maha) is a state in the western and central peninsular region of India occupying a substantial
          portion of the Deccan Plateau. Maharashtra is the second-most populous state in India and the second-most
           populous country subdivision globally. It was formed on 1 May 1960 by splitting the bilingual Bombay State, 
           which had existed since 1956, into majority Marathi-speaking Maharashtra and Gujarati-speaking Gujarat as a result
            of a nationwide organization of states based on language. Maharashtra is divided into 6 divisions and 36 districts, 
            with the state capital being Mumbai, the most populous urban area in India, and Nagpur serving as the winter capital,
             which also hosts the winter session of the state legislature.[9] Godavari and Krishna are the two major rivers in the
              state. Marathi is the most widely spoken language and is the state's only official language. The forest constitutes 16.47 
              per cent of the state's geographical area. Out of the total cultivable land in the state, about 60 per cent is used for 
              grain crops in the Deccan region, rice in coastal Konkan, and other high rainfall areas.

Spread over 307,713 km2 (118,809 sq mi), Maharashtra is the third-largest state by area in India.
 It is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, the Indian states of Karnataka and Goa to the south, 
 Telangana to the southeast and Chhattisgarh to the east, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh to the north, and the Indian union territory 
 of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the northwest.[10] The state has three international airports, 
 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (Mumbai), Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport (Nagpur), and Pune Airport.
  The state is home to three railways headquarters viz. Central Railway (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus), Konkan Railway (CBD Belapur),
   and Western Railway (Churchgate). The High Court of the state viz. Bombay High Court is located in Mumbai. The state contributes 48 seats 
   and 19 seats to the lower house Lok Sabha and the upper house Rajya Sabha, respectively. Maharashtra has been subject to President's rule 
   three times since its formation for a total of 156 days for different reasons. More than three-fourths of the population practice Hinduism, 
   which is followed by Islam and Buddhism. The predominant ethnolinguistic group of Maharashtra is the Marathi people, who speak the Marathi 
   language. The state is home to four UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Ajanta, Ellora and Elephanta caves, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj 
   Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus).
